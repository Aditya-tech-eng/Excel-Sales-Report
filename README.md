# Sales Forecasting Analysis

## Overview

This project involves forecasting sales amounts based on historical monthly data. The analysis employs three different forecasting techniques:

- **Formula-based Forecasting**: Using Excel formulas for trend projection.
- **Trendline Forecasting**: Applying a polynomial regression trendline.
- **Forecast Sheet**: Utilizing Excel's built-in forecasting tool with an **85% confidence interval**.

---

## Data Description

The dataset consists of monthly sales figures, where:

- **Month**: Represents the month of the year.
- **Number**: Represents the month index (1 = January, 2 = February, etc.).
- **Amount**: The sales amount recorded for that month.
- **Forecasted Amount**: The predicted sales value for future months using different methods.
- **Lower Confidence Bound**: The lower bound for the forecast with **85% confidence**.
- **Upper Confidence Bound**: The upper bound for the forecast with **85% confidence**.

---

## Forecasting Techniques

### **1. Formula-Based Forecasting**
- Manually calculated projections using trend-based **Excel formulas**.
- Predicts future sales based on past trends and seasonality.

### **2. Polynomial Trendline Forecasting**
- A polynomial regression equation was fitted to historical sales data:  
  - **Equation:** `y = -1869.2x² - 203.34x + 2E+06`
  - **R² = 0.841**, indicating a **good fit**.
  - Used for estimating future trends by extending the polynomial curve.

### **3. Forecast Sheet (Excel Forecast Function)**
- Uses **Exponential Smoothing** to predict future sales.
- Provides **Upper and Lower Confidence Bounds** with an **85% confidence interval**.

---

## Key Findings

- The **sales trend shows a gradual decline over time**, as indicated by all three forecasting methods.
- The **polynomial trendline provides a reasonable fit** (**R² = 0.841**), but future accuracy depends on external factors.
- The **forecast sheet method provides a confidence range**, helping in **risk assessment and decision-making**.

---

## Recommendations

### **1. Adjust Sales Strategy**
- Develop **targeted marketing campaigns** or promotions to counter the declining trend.

### **2. Inventory Management**
- Optimize stock levels based on **forecasted demand** to reduce excess inventory costs.

### **3. Explore New Revenue Streams**
- Consider **product diversification** or **geographic expansion** to offset declining sales.

### **4. Monitor External Factors**
- Keep track of **economic conditions**, **competitor strategies**, and **seasonal variations** that may impact sales.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides **data-driven insights for sales forecasting**, helping businesses make **informed decisions**.  
The combination of different forecasting techniques ensures **robust and reliable predictions** with quantified confidence levels.
